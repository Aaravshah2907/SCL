LU_Decomposition_info

[L,U] = lu(A) factorizes the full or sparse matrix A into an upper triangular matrix U and a permuted lower triangular matrix L such that A = L*U.
// QR Decomposition

[L,U,P] = lu(A) also returns a permutation matrix P such that A = P'*L*U. With this syntax, L is unit lower triangular and U is upper triangular.

[L,U,P] = lu(A,outputForm) returns P in the form specified by outputForm. Specify outputForm as 'vector' to return P as a permutation vector such that A(P,:) = L*U.

[L,U,P,Q] = lu(S) factorizes sparse matrix S into 
    a unit lower triangular matrix L, 
    an upper triangular matrix U, 
    a row permutation matrix P, and 
    a column permutation matrix Q, such that P*S*Q = L*U.

[L,U,P,Q,D] = lu(S) also returns a diagonal scaling matrix D such that P*(D\S)*Q = L*U. Typically, the row-scaling leads to a sparser and more stable factorization.
