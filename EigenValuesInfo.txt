EigenValues_info

e = eig(A) returns a column vector containing the eigenvalues of square matrix A.

[V,D] = eig(A) returns diagonal matrix D of eigenvalues and matrix V whose columns are the corresponding right eigenvectors, so that A*V = V*D.

[V,D,W] = eig(A) also returns full matrix W whose columns are the corresponding left eigenvectors, so that W'*A = D*W'.

The eigenvalue problem is to determine the solution to the equation Av = λv, where A is an n-by-n matrix, v is a column vector of length n, and λ is a scalar. 
The values of λ that satisfy the equation are the eigenvalues. The corresponding values of v that satisfy the equation are the right eigenvectors. 
The left eigenvectors, w, satisfy the equation w’A = λw’.
