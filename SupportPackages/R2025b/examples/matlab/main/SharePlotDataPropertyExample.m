%% Example: Share Plot Data and a Drop-Down List Selection
% This app shows how to share data in a private property
% and a drop-down list. It has a private property called |Z| 
% that stores plot data. The callback function for the edit field updates 
% |Z| when the user changes the sample size. The callback function for the
% *Update Plot* button gets the value of |Z| and the colormap selection to
% update the plot.
