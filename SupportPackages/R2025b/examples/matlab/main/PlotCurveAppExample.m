%% App That Calculates and Plots Simple Curves
% This example shows an app that calculates and plots simple curves. You
% can select a function to plot, then plot that function. The app uses a
% |for|-loop to calculate the |y|-axis data in your MATLAB&reg; session.
% MATLAB suspends execution while the data is being calculated, and
% therefore you are unable to stop the app or update the type of plot while
% the data is being calculated.
%
% If you run these calculations in the background instead, MATLAB does not
% suspend execution. You can interrupt calculations by stopping the app or
% updating the type of plot.
%
% Run the |PlotCurve| app by clicking the *Run* button in App Designer.
