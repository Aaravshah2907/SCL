%% Responsive App That Calculates and Plots Simple Curves
% This example shows an app that calculates and plots simple curves. You
% can select a function to plot, then plot that function. The app uses a
% |for|-loop to calculate the |y|-axis data in the background. MATLAB 
% does not suspend execution while calculating the data, and therefore you 
% are able to stop the app or update the type of plot while the data is 
% being calculated.
%
% Run the |PlotCurveBackground| app by clicking the *Run* button in App
% Designer.
