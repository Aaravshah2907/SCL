%% Create Placeholders to Test New Feature
% If you cannot write all the tests required for a new feature, use
% unconditional test failures as placeholders for the unimplemented tests.
% The failures remind you of the tests that need to be developed for your
% feature.

%%
% In a file in your current folder, create the |FeatureTest| class. Use the
% |verifyFail| method to add two placeholders to test your new feature.
%
% <include>FeatureTest.m</include>
%
%%
% If you run the tests, they both fail unconditionally.
